This is a sample writing to demonstrate how the system works.

You can add your own writings by dropping .txt files into the write/writing folder, then running the build script with:

node write/build-writings.js

Each piece will be separated by a horizontal divider, with the most recent writings appearing first.

The content preserves formatting, so you can write naturally with line breaks and spacing as you prefer.
