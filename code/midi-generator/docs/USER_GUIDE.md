3. **Deconstruct**: Import your MIDI into DAW and analyze
4. **Experiment**: Try "wrong" choices to understand why they don't work
5. **Iterate**: Generate 100 ideas, refine the best 10
6. **Study**: Read the modal content thoroughly
7. **Apply**: Use what you learn in your own productions

## ðŸŽµ Happy Music Making!

Remember: The best way to learn is by doing. Generate tons of MIDI, experiment wildly, and most importantly - have fun!
