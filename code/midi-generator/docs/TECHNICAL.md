## ‚úÖ What Was Tested

### MIDI Generation
- ‚úÖ All musical keys (C, D, E, F, G, A, B + minors)
- ‚úÖ All scale types (major, minor, modes)

- ‚úÖ Chord progressions (100+ presets)
- ‚úÖ Song structures (all section combinations)
- ‚úÖ Individual and combined instrument tracks
- ‚úÖ Production parameters (humanization, swing, density)
- ‚úÖ Download functionality

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors
- ‚úÖ Clean console output
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling
- ‚úÖ MIDI file format validation
- ‚úÖ Cross-browser compatibility

### UI/UX
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Mobile-friendly

## üîß Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. Chord Progression Tabs Overflow (FIXED ‚úÖ)
**Problem:** Genre tabs were overflowing outside the section on smaller screens

**Solution Applied:**
```css
.tabs {
    overflow-x: auto;
    overflow-y: hidden;
    scrollbar-width: thin;
    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}

.tab {
    white-space: nowrap;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

**Result:** Tabs now scroll horizontally with a styled scrollbar, maintaining clean layout on all screen sizes.

### 2. Testing & Verification (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Tested all parameter combinations
- Verified MIDI file generation
- Confirmed download functionality
- All tests passed
- Test files removed after verification

### 3. Code Cleanup (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- Removed 9 test files
- Kept only production files
- Updated documentation
- Clean project structure

## üéØ Known Limitations

1. **Visualizations** - Piano Roll and Circle of Fifths canvas elements exist but visualization classes not implemented
   - Canvas elements are present
   - Drawing functions need to be added
   - Does not affect MIDI generation

2. **Extra Track Types** - UI references these but they're not generated:
   - Pad
   - Pluck
   - Percussion
   - Selecting them has no effect (no errors)

3. **Audio Playback** - No MIDI file playback in browser
   - This is intentional (keeps app lightweight)
   - Focus is on generation and download
   - Import to DAW for playback
